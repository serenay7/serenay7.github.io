## GüneşApp

Güneş App is a platform where women can get legal and psychological support when they face unsafe situations. The platform works with non-governmental organizations and voluntary professionals to help the victims of abuse without revealing their identities. 
It is designed in the **Women's Safety Hackathon organized by Google Developer Communities Turkey** in 2020 and ranked 2nd amongst 20 projects.
