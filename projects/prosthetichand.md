## Design of a Self-Learning Prosthetic Hand Using Wireless Data Transmission and Flex Sensor

[Sude Aksaray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sude-aksaray-8387381b3/) and I worked on a prosthetic hand design with our mentor Nihal Arı Korkusuz between 2017 and 2019. With this project, we **ranked first amongst 15.000 projects** and received a **special prize** in 2019. Then we represented Turkey in the engineering branch in **EU Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS)** in September 2019.

I received a scholarship for my university education from The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK), thanks to the successful completion of the project.

For further questions about the project, please feel free to contact me.

### Project Summary

The project aims to develop a prosthetic hand that can transfer data received from the glove with a flex sensor to the disabled individuals wirelessly and memorizing the desired movement. For this purpose, the open source prosthesis hand designs are examined and the efficiency of different models are compared. Two of the models are selected and they are printed by three dimensional printer. In order to detect the desired movement of the prosthetic hand, gloves with flex sensors are placed on the fingers. The Arduino Lilypad controlled circuit uses the XBee wireless module to transfer data from gloves to prostheses.

The bending movement of the fingers of the prosthetic hand is provided by the servo motors connected with the line, while the opening movement is carried out by the tires which are tensioned in the opposite direction. Thus, when the motors stretch the line, the fingers close and when they release, they open. A keypad is added to the system in order to reduce the use of gloves and to ensure the release of the hand. Once the desired finger positions have been registered, a key can be easily switched.

As a result of this study, a learning, remote controlled prosthesis hand design which is open to development and can be used by disabled individuals has been developed.
